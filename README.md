## Description

- the course of this prework was genuinly fun to learn. I enjoyed learning the different features of what a website can do, building this was fun too as it helped me learn all the different types of "assets" (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) and what I can do with them. My problem was thinking it was going to be really hard throughout the prework but learned it was a simple fix, knowing I should be mentally aware of everything I do
